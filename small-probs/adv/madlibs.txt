When NOUN don’t want to ADVERB VERB NOUN,
they come up with every NOUN they can
VERB of to get out of it. There are many
kinds of sicknesses children try to VERB
their parents they have been afflicted with
in order to get out of going to school. The
character in this poem seems to have come
down with every possible illness, but what
happens when she realizes it’s not a school
day? Shel Silverstein VERB a ADJECTIVE NOUN that will
resonate with ADJECTIVE NOUN and NOUN alike.
